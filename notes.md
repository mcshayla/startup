git add .

git commit -m "adding a file"

git push


This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process.

    1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
    2. Make changes to the code
    3. Commit the changes (git commit)
    4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

git fetch - you can see what is on github without pulling it yet

git status - to show you if the branches ==

git pull
